# GBM_Hat
Put a gbm hat on my imagenet model, logic being that once the data as been preprocess by a pretrained imagenet model, a gbm might do better then a fully connect model for the classification

Edit : The model is very long to train and ive canceled the experiment after two days of training and no end in sight. 1000 classes seems to much to train a gbm on imagenet, even with 2000 features instead of the image
